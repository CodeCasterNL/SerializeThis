SerializeThis is a Visual Studio Extension. It lets you generate an example JSON for a class by right-clicking a type, variable or member name. This can be helpful to generate example JSON or C# object initializer code to use in unit tests or through a REST client such as [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/).

This is not meant as a replacement for documentation and client generators such as [Swagger](http://swagger.io/).

It currently looks like this:

The serialized model looks like this:

The extension creates a temp file, writes the output there, opens the file in Visual Studio and then attempts to delete the file.

Versions after 1.2.1 were only tested in VS 2019.
